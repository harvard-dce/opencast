## In order to configure a new LDAP connection, please make a copy of this file in the same directory with the name:
##
##        org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap-<ID>.cfg
##
## , where "<ID>" is an identifier, unique for each configured LDAP instance.
## Then, fill in the properties for the new LDAP connection below and ideally delete this header to avoid confusion


## A unique identifier for this connection. It only has effect within Opencast.
## May be different as the <ID> used above, but this is not recommended for clarity
## IMPORTANT: This identifier must be the same as the one used in the security.xml
## file to get a reference to an 'authoritiesPopulator'
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.id=

## The URL to the LDAP server
## Example: ldap://ldap.berkeley.edu
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.url=

## The user and password used for LDAP authentication.  If left commented, the LDAP provider will use an anonymous bind.
#org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.userDn=
#org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.password=

## The base path within LDAP to search for users
## Example: ou=people,dc=berkeley,dc=edu
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.searchbase=

## The search filter to use for identifying users by ID
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.searchfilter=(uid={0})

## The maximum number of users to cache
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.cache.size=1000

## The maximum number of minutes to cache a user
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.cache.expiration=5

## The comma-separated list of attributes that will be translated into roles.
## Note that the attributes will be converted to uppercase and that they may be prefixed with a string, as defined in the
## configuration below. Please refer to the documentation of the "roleprefix" property below.
## Example: berkeleyEduAffiliations,departmentNumber
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.roleattributes=

## The organization for this provider
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.org=mh_default_org

## A prefix to be added to the roles read by this provider. It defaults to an empty string "", i.e. no prefix added.
## Please note that this property had previous a default value of "ROLE_", which is still recommended, but not mandatory.
##
## The prefix is *NOT* added to a role if any of the following conditions is met:
##
##   * The role starts with any of the prefixes defined in the parameter 'exclude.prefixes'
##   * The role was not actually read from the provider, but defined in the 'extra.roles' list below
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.roleprefix=

## A comma-separated list of prefixes. When the roles read from LDAP start with any of these, then the prefix defined
## above is not prepended to the role.
## Please note that if the "uppercase" parameter was provided, these prefixes are converted accordingly
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.exclude.prefixes=

## Whether or not the role names should be converted to uppercase. It defaults to "true".
## Please note that this setting affects the prefix defined above.
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.uppercase=true

## A comma-separated list of extra roles to apply to all the users authenticated with this LDAP instance
## The roles in this list are converted to uppercase if the corresponding parameter is set. However, the 'roleprefix'
## setting does not affect them -i.e. they will not be further modified even if 'roleprefix' is set.
org.opencastproject.userdirectory.ldap.extra.roles=
